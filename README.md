# pdq
PDQ is a "lite" ORM (Object Relational Mapper), designed to fill the void between tools like [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper) and using a full blown ORM like EntityFramework.

Incidentally, Dapper forms the foundation of how pdq executes the queries that it builds against the database. This is because what pdq aims to excel at is formulating queries and giving the developer precise control over those queries *before* they are executed.

**So what is PDQ?**.  
PDQ stands for **P**retty **D**arn **Q**uick.  
The aim has always been to provide a intuitive development experience that allows performant queries to be written, while not re-inventing the wheel for accessing the database and materialising objects.

# History
PDQ originally came about because during the course of work we needed something that enabled us to write complex, performant queries, but at the time nothing existed (at least that myself or my team could find).  

Hence we started on the journey of writing our own.  

This proved to be a long but worthwhile one, but now the time has come for a ground-up-re-write, technology has moved on (for the better) and the original concepts behind the API, while useful, don't provide a particlarly good development experience.  

For this re-birth if you will, the attempt is to make use of a fully fluent API and provide as much of an intuitive experience as possible.
